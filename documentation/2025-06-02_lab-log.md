## ✅ Actions Completed

- Successfully pushed project to GitHub via HTTPS
  - Verified Git configuration and authentication

- `README.md` is central to both professionalism and clarity
- Documentation folder will serve as a growing technical journal

- Add limited MySQL user
- Enable Apache + firewall rules
- Track all of the above in this folder as separate logs

## ✍️ Reflections

Today felt like the beginning of something structured — not just installing packages, but laying down intentional digital architecture. This log marks the first footprint of a deeper system.
