## ✅ Completed Today

- Pulled down upstream changes from GitHub
- Resolved merge conflict via CLI (`:wq!` to exit Vim)
- Synced local and remote master branches
- Prepared to initialize `/documentation` structure
- Setup and committed `README.md` enhancements

---

## 🧠 Observations

- Git offered a clean merge once remote changes were accepted.
- Vim opened during merge — required `:wq!` due to readonly.
- No conflicts in the actual files, just a sync mismatch.

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Expand documentation with additional logs
- Finalize phpMyAdmin secure login
- Tighten file/folder permissions
- Harden firewall rules
